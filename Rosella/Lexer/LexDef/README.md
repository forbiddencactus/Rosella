# Rosella Lexer
The RosellaFlexOutput files here are generated by Flex (https://github.com/westes/flex). They are part of Rosella's lexer. 

To regenerate these files, you need to install Flex and then run it on RosellaLexDef.l. You can install Flex through most package managers. For instance:

    brew install flex
