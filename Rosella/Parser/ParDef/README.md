# Rosella Parser
The files here are generated by the Bison parser generator (https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/). They are part of Rosella's parser. 

To regenerate these files, install Bison and then run it on RosellaParDef.y. You can install Lemon through most package managers. For instance:

    brew install bison
